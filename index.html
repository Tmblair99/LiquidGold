		<h2>Old Fashioned</h2>
			<p>Old fashions are a staple drink in any cocktail list. They are super simple and have very few ingredients. With such few ingredients it is very important to have quality ingredients because this will be a very spirit forward cocktail</p>
		<ul>
			<li>2oz Bardstown Rye Whiskey (or any quality whiskey you enjoy, I reccommend a rye whiskey)</li>
			<li>4 dashes Angostora Bitters</li>
			<li>4 dashes Orange Bitters</li>
			<li>1/2oz simple syrup</li>
			<li>1 orange peel</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Directions</h3>
		<p>Combine all ingredients into a mixing glass over ice and stir for approximately 30 seconds. This will help to cool the drink and dilute with water to get the best flavour. Strain over large sphere cube of ice and garnish with orange peel.</p>

		<h2>Whiskey Sour</h2>
			<p>Whiskey sours are another classic cocktail that is perfect for a Summer get together. Its a sweet and citrusy cocktail that when made correctly has a fun velvety texture</p>
		<ul>
			<li>2oz Bardstown Rye Whiskey (again this can be substituted with any whiskey or bourbon you prefer)</li>
			<li>1oz fresh lime juice</li>
			<li>1oz simple syrup</li>
			<li>1 egg white (can be substituted with Fee Foam)</li>
			<li>*OPTIONAL* Drops of Angostora bitters for garnish</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Directions</h3>
		<p>Combine all ingredients into a shaker and dry shake the ingredients for 30 seconds. This will help create a thick foam on the top of the drink. Add ice to shaker and shake again until cold. Strain drink into coupe glass and garnish with bitters.</p>
