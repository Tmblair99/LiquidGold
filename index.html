		<h2>Old Fashioned</h2>
			<p>Old fashions are a staple drink in any cocktail list. They are super simple and have very few ingredients. With such few ingredients it is very important to have quality ingredients because this will be a very spirit forward cocktail</p>
		<ul>
			<li>2oz Bardstown Rye Whiskey (or any quality whiskey you enjoy, I reccommend a rye whiskey)</li>
			<li>4 dashes Angostora Bitters</li>
			<li>4 dashes Orange Bitters</li>
			<li>1/2oz simple syrup</li>
			<li>1 orange peel</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Directions</h3>
		<p>Combine all ingredients into a mixing glass over ice and stir for approximately 30 seconds. This will help to cool the drink and dilute with water to get the best flavour. Strain over large sphere cube of ice and garnish with orange peel.</p>
